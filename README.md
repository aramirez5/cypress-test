## What is cypress-test ?

<b>cypress-test</b> is a proyect that served as a technical test
for a job interview.

I used the cypress framework to do the challenge, which consists
of three exercises: the first is an E2E test and the other two 
are API requests.


## Building and installation

We need to install Node 14.18.21

See [www.nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) for more information.

Once Node installed, just follow the next steps:

```sh
# Install Cypress
npm install --save-dev cypress@10.3.0
